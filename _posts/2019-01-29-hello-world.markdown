I used to like Twitter and some discussions that we're had on this platform. However, i've always considered posts to be ephemeral, things are forgotten and not so easily searchable. Because of this, I decided to pick up blogging again.

I'd like to start reviewing some books i'm reading, publishing of research and some good 'ol banter.

2019 will be interesting.
